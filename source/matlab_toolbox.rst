   XB_WRITE_WAVES  Writes wave definition files for XBeach input
   
   Writes JONSWAP or variance density spectrum files for XBeach input. In
   case of conditions changing in time, a file list file is created
   refering to multiple wave definition files. In case of a JONSWAP
   spectrum, the file list file can be omitted and a single matrix
   formatted file is created. Returns the filename of the file to be
   referred in the params.txt file.
   
   In order to generate time varying wave conditions, simply add an extra
   dimension to the input arguments specifying the spectrum. The
   single-valued parameters Hm0, Tp, dir, gammajsp, s fnyq, duration and
   timestep then become one-dimensional. The one- and two-dimensional
   parameters freqs, dirs and vardens then become two- and
   three-dimensional respectively. It is not necessary to provide
   time-varying values for all parameters. In case a specific parameter is
   constant, simply provide the constant value. The value is reused in
   each period of time. However, it is not possible to provide for one
   parameter more than one value and for another too, while the number of
   values is not the same.

.. code:: text

   XB_DAT_READ  Bytewise reading of XBeach DAT files using strides
   
   Reading of XBeach DAT files. Two read methods are available: minimal
   reads and minimal memory. The former minimizes the number of fread
   calls, while the latter minimizes the amount of data read into memory.
   In case the number of reads is for both methods equal, the memory
   method is used. This method is also used if the average number of reads
   per item is less than with the read method. The method used can also be
   forced. The requested data can be determined using start and end
   indices for each dimension and strides. This approach is similar to the
   netCDF toolbox. The dimensions of the DAT file provided are in general
   in the order x,y,t. The dimension order of the output is t,y,x to match
   the netCDF conventions. The start and end indices and strides should be
   provided in t,y,x order. The result is a matrix containing the
   requested data.
   
   Preferences:
   dat_method  = Force read method (read/memory)
   
               Preferences overwrite default options (not explicitly
               defined options) and can be set and retrieved using the
               xb_setpref and xb_getpref functions.
   
   Syntax:
   dat = xb_dat_read(fname, dims, varargin)
   
   Input:
   fname       = Filename of DAT file
   dims        = Array with lengths of all dimensions in DAT file
   varargin    = start:    Start positions for reading in each dimension,
                           first item is zero
                 length:   Number of data items to be read in each
                           dimension, negative is unlimited
                 stride:   Stride to be used in each dimension
                 index:    Cell array with indices to read in each
                           dimension (overwrites start/length/stride)
                 threshold:Fraction of items to read in order to switch to
                           read method
                 maxreads: Maximum reads in memory method
                 force:    Force read method (read/memory)
   
   Output:
   dat         = Matrix with dimensions defined in dims containing
                 requested data from DAT file
   
   Example:
   dat = xb_dat_read(fname, [100 3 20]);
   dat = xb_dat_read(fname, [100 3 20], 'start', 10, 'length', 90, 'stride', 2);

   itself.
   
   The last character of each variable name indicates the location within
   a grid cell for which the value is computed (z, u, v or c, see
   illustration). The variable name further consists of x or y,
   indicating a location in world coordinates, or of ds or dn, indicating
   distances or surfaces in grid coordinates. The dsdn* variables are grid
   cell surfaces. The alfa* variables are orientations of the specified

   XB_GRID_XGRID  Creates a model grid in x-direction based on bathymetry
   
   Function to interpolate (no extrapolation) profile measurements to
   cross shore consant or varying grid for an XBeach profile model. Cross
   shore grid size is limited by user-defined minimum grid size in shallow
   water and land, long wave resolution on offshore boundary, depth to
   grid size ratio and grid size smoothness constraints. The function uses
   the Courant condition to find the optimal grid size given these
   constraints.
   
   Optional input in keyword,value pairs
     - xgrid    :: [m] vector which defines the variable xgrid
     - Tm       :: [s] incident short wave period (used for maximum grid size at offshore boundary) 
                       if you impose time series of wave conditions use the min(Tm) as input (default = 5)
     - dxmin    :: [m] minimum required cross shore grid size (usually over land) (default = 1)
     - dxmax    :: [m] user-specified maximum grid size, when usual wave
                       period / CFL condition does not suffice (default Inf)
     - vardx    :: [-] 0 = constant dx, 1 = varying dx (default = 1)
     - g        :: [ms^-2] gravity constant (default = 9.81)
     - CFL      :: [-] Courant number in grid generator (default = 0.9)
     - dtref    :: [-] Ref value for dt in computing dx from CFL (default = 4)
     - maxfac   :: [-] Maximum allowed grid size ratio between adjacent cells (default = 1.15)
     - dy, 5    :: [m] dy (default = 5)
     - wl,0     :: [m] water level elevation relative to bathymetry used to estimate water depth (default = 0)
     - depthfac :: [-] Maximum gridsize to water depth ratio (default = 2)
   
   Syntax:
   [xgr zgr] = xb_grid_xgrid(xin, zin, varargin)
   
   Input:
   xin   = vector with cross-shore coordinates; increasing from zero

.. code:: text

   XB_GRID_YGRID  Creates a model grid in y-direction based on minimum and maximum cell size and area of interest
   
   Generates a model grid in y-direction using two grid cellsizes. The
   minimum grid cellsize is used for the area of interest. The maximum is
   used near the lateral borders. A gradual transition between the grid
   cellsizes over a specified distance is automatically generated. The
   area of interest can be defined in several manners. By default, this is
   a distance of 100m in the center of the model.
   
   Syntax:
   ygr = xb_grid_ygrid(yin, varargin)
   
   Input:
   yin       = range of y-coordinates to be included in the grid
   varargin  = dymin:                  minimum grid cellsize
               dymax:                  maximum grid cellsize
               area_type:              type of definition of the area of
                                       interest (center/range)
               area_size:              size of the area of interest
                                       (length or fraction in case of
                                       area_type center, from/to range in
                                       case of area_type range)
               transition_distance:    distance over which the grid
                                       cellsize is gradually changed from
                                       mimumum to maximum, a negative
                                       value means the distance may be
                                       adapted to limit the error made in
                                       the fit

   XB_GET_BIN  Retrieves a XBeach binary from a remote source
   
   Retrieves a XBeach binary from a remote source. By default this is the
   latest binary from the TeamCity build server. Several flavours of
   binaries exist. By default the normal win32 binary is downloaded. A
   custom host can be provided as well. Returns the location where the
   downloaded binary can be found.
   
   WARNING: SOME BINARY TYPES ARE STILL MISSING, SINCE NOT AVAILABLE IN
   TEAMCITY YET
   
   Syntax:
   fpath = xb_get_bin(varargin)
   
   Input:
   varargin  = type:       Type of binary (win32/unix/mpi/netcdf).
                           Multiple qualifiers separated by a space can be
                           used. Specifying "custom" will use the host
                           provided in the equally named varargin
                           parameter.
               host:       Host to be used in case of custom type.
   
   Output:

~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: text

   XB_RESUME  Resumes XBeach model run from certain moment
   
   Combines an existing model setup with a bathymetry from the
   corresponding model output into a new model setup. Given a certain
   simulation time, the bathymetry closest to this time is obtained from
   the model output. The input bathymetry from the existing model setup is
   replaced with this evolved bathymetry. The boundary conditions and
   simulation times are adjusted to fit the bathymetry used.
   If the given simulation time is not present in the model output, the
   available simulation time closest to the given value is used.
   
   Syntax:
   xb = xb_resume(xb, varargin)
   
   Input:
   xb        = XBeach run structure or path to model setup
   varargin  = t:      simulation time at which bathymetry is read
               spinup: spinup time to use in newly generated model setup
   
   Output:
   xb        = New model setup with evolved bathymetry
   
   Example:
   xbm = xb_resume(xbr, 't', 1000)
   xbm = xb_resume(xbr, 't', 1000, 'spinup', 100)

.. code:: text

   XB_VIEW  Generic GUI to visualize XBeach input and output
   
   Graphical User Interface to visualize input and output. The viewer is
   *complementary* to the Delft3D QuickPlot (QP) viewer. Most options you
   find in this viewer are lacking in QP and vise versa.
   
   This viewer accepts XBeach input, output and run structures or a path
   string to an XBeach output directory. In case no input is given, the
   current directory is assumed to contain XBeach output. It is also
   possible to provide a cell array with different datasources. These
   sources can be a mix of types (structures and paths), but need to have
   the same spatial grid and equal timestep.
   
   The most important options are:
       * 1D, 2D and 3D plots
       * Multiple variable selection
       * Time sliders and animation
       * Time difference plots
       * Time comparison plots
       * Multiple datasource comparison plots
       * Transect view for 2D models with transect slider
       * Fixation and alignment of caxis
       * Measurement tool

   Syntax:
   xb_view(data, varargin)
   
   Input:
   data      = XBeach structure (input, output or run) or path to XBeach
   Output:
   varargin  = width:  Width of window at startup (inf = screensize)
               height: Height of window at startup (inf = screensize)
               model:  Boolean indicating modal state
