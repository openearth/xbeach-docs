abstract = {An exact generalized theory of Lagrangian-mean flow is constructed for describing the effect of oscillatory disturbances on the mean state. It is shown that there is a natural choice among the family of transformations considered by Eckart (1963) which leads to a simple yet exact definition of the generalized Lagrangian-mean velocity and to finite-amplitude versions of the basic theorems on mean-flow evolution. The approach leads to what may be the first exact definition of pseudomomentum, or wave 'momentum'. It is shown that the difference between the Lagrangian mean velocity and the pseudomomentum per unit mass is exactly irrotational whenever the total motion is irrotational. An application of this to inviscid acoustic streaming is given.},

The near surface shear stress is found to be in the direction of wave propagation, having a magnitude determined by the dissipation of wave energy.

abstract = {In recent years, several attempts to stabilize the beach by control of the percolation of water have been proposed. However, morphodynamics in the surf zone is still not clear because of the complexity of wave actions and sediment transport. Especially, there is a little research on gravel beach morphodynamics including wave breaking in the surf zone. The present study investigates experimentally how groundwater level influences topographic changes in a gravel beach and simulates numerically the wave fields and flow patterns in the surf zone, considering the porosity of the media and the presence of groundwater. In experiments, water-level control tank was designed to control the simulated groundwater elevation and the wave flume was divided into two parts to maintain a constant mean water level. The experimental results show that the berm formed in the upper portion of the shoreline moves up the beach as the groundwater level falls and the lower the groundwater level, the steeper the beach surface. The numerical model was developed to clarify these features capable of simulating the difference of groundwater and mean water level. Numerical results showed different flow patterns due to the groundwater elevation; wave run-up weakens and wave run-down strengthens by the seaward currents caused by elevated groundwater. These deformations of the flow pattern explain well how the beach profile is affected by the groundwater elevation. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The flow dynamics, however, are not well-understood. This paper presents a numerical study of the instantaneous (i.e., phase-resolved) wave motion and resulting groundwater responses in the beach zone. Simulations conducted for a representative beach reveal various important features of the flow. In particular, periodic local groundwater circulation occurs below progressive bores while the averaged flow behaviour is characterised by continuous circulation (due to wave set-up) extending from the upper part of the beach to the lower part. These results are analysed and compared with previous analytical solutions derived for simplified situations. The findings will assist future studies to quantify the effects of beach groundwater flow on other coastal processes.},

abstract = {Communities of benthic organisms can form very rough surfaces ( canopies) on the seafloor. Previous studies have shown that an oscillatory flow induced by monochromatic surface waves will drive more flow inside a canopy than a comparable unidirectional current. This paper builds on these previous studies by investigating how wave energy is attenuated within canopies under spectral wave conditions, or random wave fields defined by many frequencies. A theoretical model is first developed to predict how flow attenuation within a canopy varies among the different wave components and predicts that shorter-period components will generally be more effective at driving flow within a canopy than longer-period components. To investigate the model performance, a field experiment was conducted on a shallow reef flat in which flow was measured both inside and above a model canopy array. Results confirm that longer-period components in the spectrum are significantly more attenuated than shorter-period components, in good agreement with the model prediction. This paper concludes by showing that the rate at which wave energy is dissipated by a canopy is closely linked to the flow structure within the canopy. Under spectral wave conditions, wave energy within a model canopy array is dissipated at a greater rate among the shorter-period wave components. These observations are consistent with previous observations of how wave energy is dissipated by the bottom roughness of a coral reef.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a process-based numerical model for the prediction of storm hydrodynamics and hydrology on gravel beaches. The model comprises an extension of an existing open-source storm-impact model for sandy coasts (XBeach), through the application of (1) a non-hydrostatic pressure correction term that allows wave-by-wave modelling of the surface elevation and depth-averaged flow, and (2) a groundwater model that allows infiltration and exfiltration through the permeable gravel bed to be simulated, and is referred to as XBeach-G. Although the model contains validated sediment transport relations for sandy environments, transport relations for gravel in the model are currently under development and unvalidated. Consequently, all simulations in this paper are carried out without morphodynamic feedback. Modelled hydrodynamics are validated using data collected during a large-scale physical model experiment and detailed in-situ field data collected at Loe Bar, Cornwall, UK, as well as remote-sensed data collected at four gravel beach locations along the UK coast during the 2012-2013 storm season. Validation results show that the model has good skill in predicting wave transformation (overall SCI 0.14-0.21), run-up levels (SCI < 0.12; median error < 10\%) and initial wave overtopping (85-90\% prediction rate at barrier crest), indicating that the model can be applied to estimate potential storm impact on gravel beaches. The inclusion of the non-hydrostatic pressure correction term and groundwater model is shown to significantly improve the prediction and evolution of overtopping events. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Diurnal and semidiurnal water table fluctuations are almost completely damped 100 m landward of the mean shoreline location on this fine-grained sand beach, but fluctuations at spring-neap periods (approximate to 14 days) are attenuated less. Comparison of the observations with the predictions suggests that the asymmetries in the water table level time series measured in this study result from nonlinearity owing to the large (relative to the wavelength) horizontal shoreline excursions, rather than from nonlinearity owing to finite-amplitude water table fluctuations. Cross-shore variations of the aquifer depth are predicted to have a small effect on the landward decay rate of the water table fluctuations. The seepage face width is predicted accurately and depends on the nonplanar beach profile. In general, the development of a seepage face is predicted to have little effect on the water table level landward of the intertidal region.},

abstract = {Numerical computations are used to explain the presence of very low frequency motions (VLFs), with frequencies less than 0.004 Hz, in the rip current velocity signals observed during the Rip-current field Experiment (RIPEX) field experiment. Observations show that the VLF motions are most intense within the surfzone and then quickly taper off in the offshore direction. By comparing computed VLF intensity (U-RMS, (vlf)) distributions in both the cross-shore and alongshore direction with observations in a qualitative sense, the most important contributions to the VLF dynamics are established. VLF motions at neighboring rip-channels are seen to interact in the computations, with stronger surfzone intensity for increasing bathymetric variation. The intermittent forcing by spatially varying wave groups is essential in obtaining the correct U-RMS, (vlf) distribution in the cross-shore direction, suggesting this is the predominant mechanism responsible for the generation of the VLF motions observed during RIPEX. Computations also suggest that VLF motions can occasionally propagate offshore but are mostly confined to the surfzone corresponding to surfzone eddies. A quantitative comparison shows good correspondence between model computations and measurements of U-RMS, (vlf) with a model skill of O(0.7), with generally increased (decreased) U-RMS, (vlf) during mean low (high) water levels.},

Application to laboratory and field situations is emphasized throughout. When compared with known results for wave speed, results from the method agree closely. Results for fluid velocities are compared with experiment and agreement found to be good, unlike results from analytical theories for high waves. The problem of shoaling waves can conveniently be studied using the present method because of its validity for all wavelengths except the solitary wave limit, using the conventional first-order approximation that on a sloping bottom the waves at any depth act as if the bed were horizontal. Wave period, energy flux and mass flux are conserved. Comparisons with cxperimental results show good agreement.},

abstract = {Non-hydrostatic models such as Surface WAves till SHore (SWASH) resolve many of the relevant physics in coastal wave propagation such as dispersion, shoaling, refraction, dissipation and nonlinearity. However, for efficiency, they assume a single-valued surface and therefore do not resolve some aspects of breaking waves such as wave overturning, turbulence generation, and air entrainment. To study the ability of such models to represent nonlinear wave dynamics and statistics in a dissipative surf zone, we compare simulations with SWASH to flume observations of random, unidirectional waves, incident on a 1:30 planar beach. The experimental data includes a wide variation in the incident wave fields, so that model performance can be studied over a large range of wave conditions. Our results show that, without specific calibration, the model accurately predicts second-order bulk parameters such as wave height and period, the details of the spectral evolution, and higher-order statistics, such as skewness and asymmetry of the waves. Monte Carlo simulations show that the model can capture the principal features of the wave probability density function in the surf zone, and that the spectral distribution of dissipation in SWASH is proportional to the frequency squared, which is consistent with observations reported by earlier studies. These results show that relatively efficient non-hydrostatic models such as SWASH can be successfully used to parametrize surf zone wave processes. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The energy of waves propagating through vegetation is dissipated due to the work done by the waves on the vegetation. Dalrymple et al. (1984) estimated wave dissipation by integrating the force on a cylinder over its vertical extent. This was extended by Mendez and Losada (2004) to include varying depths and the effects of wave damping due to vegetation and wave breaking for narrow-banded random waves. This paper describes the wave dissipation over a vegetation field by the implementation of the Mendez and Losada formulation in a full spectrum model SWAN, with an extension to include a vertical layer schematization for the vegetation. The present model is validated with the original equation and results from Mendez and Losada (2004). The sensitivity of the model to the shape of the frequency spectrum, directional spreading and layer schematization are investigated. The model is then applied to field measurements by using a vegetation factor. This model has the ability to calculate two-dimensional wave dissipation over a vegetation field including some important aspects such as breaking and diffraction as used in SWAN model. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In the time-averaged equations of energy and momentum the energy flux, radiation stress and energy dissipation are determined by simple approximations which include the effect of the surface roller in the breaker and the actual shape of the waves. To the first approximation the roller represents a volume of water moving with the wave speed. It significantly changes both energy flux and radiation stress of the surf zone waves. The equations of energy and momentum are solved simultaneously to give the wave height variation and the set-up. Comparison with measurements shows good agreement. Also the transitions immediately after breaking are analyzed and shown to be in accordance with the above-mentioned ideas and results.},

abstract = {A computational procedure has been developed for simulating non-hydrostatic, free-surface, rotational flows in one and two horizontal dimensions. Its implementation in the publicly available SWASH (an acronym of Simulating WAves till SHore) is intended to be used for predicting transformation of surface waves and rapidly varied shallow water flows in coastal waters. This open source code (http://swash.sourceforge.net) has been developed based on the work of Stelling and Zijlema (2003), Stelling and Duinmeijer (2003) and Zijlema and Stelling (2005, 2008). The governing equations are the nonlinear shallow water equations including non-hydrostatic pressure and provide a general basis for describing complex changes to rapidly varied flows typically found in coastal flooding resulting from e.g. dike breaks and tsunamis, and wave transformation in both surf and swash zones due to nonlinear wave-wave interactions, interaction of waves with currents, and wave breaking as well as runup at the shoreline. The present paper provides a complete description of the numerical algorithms currently used in the code. The code is benchmarked using some analytical problems. Moreover, the numerical results are validated with various cases of laboratory data with the principal aim to convey the capabilities of the SWASH code. In particular, emphasis is put on an analysis of model performance and associated physical implications. Serial and parallel performance scalings are also presented. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},
